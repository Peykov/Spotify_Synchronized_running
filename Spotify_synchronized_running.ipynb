    "##### An application for wearable (GARMIN) devices that syncs your music with your running/cycling pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope: \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Develop a simple Connect IQ App sending data to a server using a Bluetooth connection\n",
    "\n",
    "-  IQ SDK Application built in Monkey C language\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  Setting a Flask server \n",
    "\n",
    "- Seting up a local server that listens to incoming pace data from the device.\n",
    "    - cmd: $ ipconfig (ip address) \n",
    "- Device: Fenix 5s Plus\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- capturing the incoming data in the Flask route, storing, manipulation and sending instructions to the Spotify API\n",
    "- a playlist is loaded before the run and sorted by BPM in bins. The program needs to navigate through the bins and play the songs in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spotify side\n",
    "\n",
    "- sorting the music playlist by BPM in groups of simililar songs for the various running paces/stages\n",
    "- when a new song/songs are imported to the playlist a pipline is triggered and the song is added to the correct cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "### UI/UX. Buttons of the watch application\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Next bin (+ 5 BPM) \n",
    "    - Previous bin (- 5 BPM)\n",
    "    - Next song in the current bin\n",
    "    - Auto: Sync with current running cadence\n",
    "    - Other metrics: Heart rate, pace\n",
